- **Custom Script Location:** You can also run scripts from any location without installing them. In Photoshop:
  - Go to **File > Scripts > Browse** and select your script file.

- **Debugging and Errors:**
  - If the script doesn't appear or work, check the script file for errors or compatibility with your Photoshop version.

- **Advanced Installation for Extensions:**
  - Some scripts are packaged as `.zxp` files. In such cases, use Adobe Extension Manager or a third-party installer like **Anastasiyâ€™s Extension Manager** to install them.
